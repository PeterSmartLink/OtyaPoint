# OtyaPoint production readiness runbook

This runbook reflects the current Cloudflare-first direction. It is a release gate checklist, not a claim that production readiness has been achieved. Keep live money movement disabled until every applicable gate is verified.

## 1. Canonical runtime

- Source of truth: GitHub repository `PeterSmartLink/OtyaPoint`.
- API runtime target: Cloudflare Worker `otyapoint-api`.
- Business database target: Cloudflare D1 `otyapoint-db`.
- Private object storage and recovery snapshots: R2 buckets `otyapoint-private` and `otyapoint-backups`.
- Cache: configured OtyaPoint KV namespace.
- Identity: shared Otya Auth Worker, with OtyaPoint-local staff membership and authorization.
- Transactional email: shared Resend configuration where needed.

The Wrangler configuration disables public `workers.dev` access and declares no custom route. The API Worker is not confirmed deployed. Do not enable a public route until the restricted preview and release gates pass. Never copy secrets into source control or chat.

## 2. Current recovery evidence

On 2026-10-30, SQL snapshots for both `otyapoint-db` and `omnipoint-dev` were uploaded to `otyapoint-backups`, retrieved successfully, and restored into isolated EU D1 databases. The restored databases each reproduced 35 schema objects, all three migration records, and the nine core business-table row counts. Both snapshots have recorded SHA-256 hashes in `cloudflare-api/README.md`.

This is a successful point-in-time restore test. It does **not** establish automated backup scheduling, retention, alerting, or recovery point objectives. Keep both snapshots and restore databases until a separate cleanup review. The two source databases' `d1_migrations` definitions differ, so preserve both snapshots and histories until the canonical database decision is made.

## 3. Data preservation and canonical database

- Compare schema definitions, migration history, row counts, and row contents using read-only queries.
- Preserve `omnipoint-dev` and `otyapoint-db` until application bindings and data ownership are confirmed.
- Select one authoritative writable OtyaPoint database only after review. Avoid dual writes.
- Keep R2 snapshots private and test object retrieval/checksums.
- Establish a scheduled backup process, retention policy, failure alert, and recurring isolated restore drill.
- Never delete a database, bucket, KV namespace, or queue merely because its name contains “old” or “dev”.

## 4. Identity, staff access, and owner recovery

- Verify the Otya Auth token contract, issuer, audience, expiry, revocation, and service-to-service authentication expectations.
- The existing dashboard bridge currently mints a local HS256 token and sends it to Otya Auth `/auth/verify`. That contract is unverified; do not enable it in production.
- Ensure a valid Otya identity does not grant OtyaPoint access without an active local staff membership.
- Test least-privilege roles, company scoping, disabled staff, expired/revoked sessions, and denied requests.
- Create the first manager through a reviewed, authenticated administrative procedure. Do not create a public bootstrap endpoint, store passwords in SQL, or grant a role solely because an email address matches.
- Verify audit records for staff provisioning and privilege changes.
- Test owner recovery without weakening MFA or bypassing normal authorization.

## 5. Application build and CI

- Run GitHub Actions verification and fix failures rather than bypassing security checks.
- Validate D1 migrations and their order.
- Run both SQLite schema test suites, Worker type-checking, Wrangler dry-run bundling, lint, and the dashboard build.
- Use reproducible dependency installation only after a committed lockfile exists and matches the supported Node/npm version.
- Audit legacy Prisma/Supabase imports and remove runtime dependencies only in reviewed, tested changes after the dashboard is migrated to the Cloudflare API.
- Require review and successful checks before merging deployment-related changes.

## 6. Private preview and operational monitoring

- Deploy only to a restricted preview without changing DNS, public routes, or the existing customer-facing site.
- Verify required bindings and secret presence without printing secret values.
- Test health, identity, authorization, inventory, staff, stock adjustments, cash-sale idempotency, ledger balance, and rollback behavior.
- Confirm logs and traces redact sensitive values, and verify alert routing with a controlled non-production alert.
- Test queue producer/consumer behavior, retries, dead-letter handling, and idempotency before attaching a consumer.
- Verify backup schedules, restore procedures, and incident response contacts.

## 7. Payment and financial launch gates

Keep Airtel Money, MTN MoMo, Interswitch/Quickteller, and all real-money actions disabled until:
- Provider approval and sandbox flows are verified.
- Callback signatures, timestamps, replay protection, and idempotency are implemented and tested.
- Timeouts, duplicate callbacks, retries, reversals, reconciliation, and failed/rolled-back transactions are covered.
- Ledger entries remain balanced and immutable, with audit trails for every financial operation.
- Provider IP allow-list requirements are met through an approved, stable egress design if required.
- Applicable Uganda tax, financial-service, consumer, and data-protection obligations have been reviewed with qualified professionals.

## 8. Cleanup policy

A resource is eligible for deletion only after:
1. Its live bindings, code references, queue producers/consumers, and domain dependencies are checked.
2. Its data is inventoried and, if applicable, backed up and restore-tested.
3. A replacement is operational and monitored.
4. The proposed deletion is recorded in a reviewed change.
5. A rollback or recovery path exists.

Never delete canonical Otya Auth/core/store Workers, Otya assets/release artifacts, or any database with unverified data dependencies as part of routine cleanup.
