# OtyaPoint Cloudflare-only dashboard and Otya Auth migration runbook

Last reviewed: 2026-10-30

## Goal

Finish the existing OtyaPoint application as one connected system: GitHub source, Cloudflare dashboard/runtime and D1 business data, Otya Auth as the shared identity authority, and Resend for transactional email. This runbook is an implementation gate, not a claim that the migration or deployment has already happened.

## Verified starting point

- The Cloudflare API entry point is `cloudflare-api/src/index.ts`; its Wrangler configuration is `wrangler.toml`.
- The Worker verifies a bearer token by calling `GET https://auth/auth/verify` through the `AUTH` service binding. It requires `{ ok: true, user_id: <non-empty string> }`, then resolves the identity against `omni_staff_memberships.identity_subject`.
- `GET /api/me`, `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/summary`, `POST /api/products`, `POST /api/stock-adjustments`, and `POST /api/sales` are implemented in the Worker. Sales remain cash-only; non-cash methods are disabled.
- Regression coverage for missing tokens, failed identity verification, Auth service failure, inactive staff, unknown roles, and successful identity-to-staff mapping was merged in PR #82.
- The dashboard login action in `app/login/actions.ts` still calls `createSupabaseServerClient()`. Other active Supabase SSR, Supabase admin, Prisma, middleware, staff invitation, and data-access paths remain. The dashboard is not yet fully connected to the Cloudflare API.
- The legacy `app/api/bridge/products/route.ts` locally signs an HS256 token. That locally minted token is not an Otya Auth access token and must not be forwarded to Otya Auth `/auth/verify`. Do not configure this bridge as a trusted identity path.
- A direct read-only Cloudflare account inventory on 2026-10-30 listed only `otya-auth`, `otya-core`, and `otya-next`; querying the deployment endpoint for `otyapoint-api` returned 404 (Worker does not exist). Therefore the OtyaPoint API Worker is **not deployed in the inspected account**. No custom Worker route is configured in the checked-in Wrangler config. Do not infer live availability from local code or passing CI.

## Target trust boundaries

1. **Otya Auth owns identity:** credentials, login, access-token issuance, refresh-token rotation/revocation, email verification, account recovery and account security.
2. **OtyaPoint owns business authorization:** a verified Otya Auth `user_id` must map to a provisioned, active `omni_staff_memberships.identity_subject`. Role and company/branch scopes are read from D1, never from client-provided claims.
3. **Cloudflare D1 owns business state:** product, stock, sales, ledger, agency and audit writes go through the OtyaPoint Worker. Do not introduce a second active writer or client-side privileged database credentials.
4. **The browser gets a secure session boundary:** access and refresh tokens must not be placed in localStorage, URLs, logs, analytics, or client-visible environment variables. Use Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies with deliberate Path/Domain/expiry settings, CSRF protections for state-changing browser requests, and server-side refresh/logout handling. Cookie domain and hosting topology must be verified before implementation.
5. **Resend remains shared email transport:** Otya Auth owns identity/security messages; OtyaPoint business notifications must use approved server-side templates/recipients and avoid secrets or payment credentials in email.

## Required implementation phases

### Phase A — establish the actual dashboard runtime

- Identify the canonical production hostname and current runtime for the Next.js dashboard. Do not assume the API Worker is the dashboard host.
- Choose and test a Cloudflare-compatible Next.js deployment path using the existing repository and a preview environment. Keep the API Worker as a separately bounded service until routing and service bindings are verified.
- Bind Otya Auth using a Cloudflare service binding where the dashboard runtime supports it; otherwise use a narrowly scoped server-side endpoint with an explicitly designed trust contract. Never expose a privileged internal secret to browser code.
- Keep production routes and DNS unchanged until preview acceptance and explicit release approval.

### Phase B — implement login and browser sessions

- Replace the Supabase-backed `signInAction` with a server-side call to Otya Auth `POST /auth/login`, after validating the real request/response contract against the current Auth implementation.
- Use the returned access token only server-side; set the refresh token in an HttpOnly Secure cookie. Keep both out of HTML, browser storage and logs.
- Add server-side `/api/account-session` handlers for current-session lookup, refresh/rotation and logout/revocation. Clear cookies on invalid/expired/revoked sessions.
- Verify CSRF protection, origin checks, cookie scope, redirect allowlisting, refresh-token rotation races, and safe behavior during Auth outage.
- Never create a second user/identity database in OtyaPoint. Never mint an Otya Auth JWT locally.

### Phase C — staff provisioning and authorization

- Create an audited, owner-authorized staff provisioning path that maps a real Otya Auth user ID to an OtyaPoint company/branch and allowed role.
- Prevent self-assigned roles, client-supplied company IDs, duplicate active memberships where disallowed, and cross-company data access.
- Test suspended/deactivated staff, revoked sessions, unknown roles, branch restrictions, identity changes, and missing staff membership.
- Do not automatically grant staff access merely because an email address matches.

### Phase D — migrate dashboard data paths

- Replace Supabase-backed product reads and writes with the OtyaPoint Worker endpoints.
- Migrate inventory, sales, staff management, dashboard summary, reports, and other discovered data paths one feature at a time.
- Add request/response contract tests and UI-level tests for each migrated feature.
- Use idempotency keys for sale submissions and preserve the existing replay/conflict behavior.
- Keep the existing source database read-only for recovery/reference during migration. No dual writes.
- Only remove Supabase/Prisma packages, environment variables, middleware and code after repository-wide import/search checks, build, lint, route tests, and recovery checks prove there are no remaining active dependencies.

### Phase E — release and recovery gate

- Confirm schema migrations, target D1 ID, backup object, SHA-256, and restore test before any remote schema operation.
- Confirm all authentication, authorization, product, stock, sale, ledger, audit, and UI acceptance tests in a Cloudflare preview using synthetic data.
- Confirm no payment provider can execute live transactions; non-cash payment methods remain disabled until separately approved and provider-certified.
- Record the exact Worker version, route, bindings, rollback version, recovery snapshot and post-release smoke checks.
- Obtain explicit production release approval before changing secrets, DNS, routes, live Worker versions, remote D1 schema/data, or payment settings.

## Acceptance criteria

- Login, refresh, logout, verification and recovery use Otya Auth; there is no Supabase login fallback.
- Tokens cannot be read by browser JavaScript and are never logged.
- The OtyaPoint Worker only accepts tokens verified by Otya Auth; staff membership, role and company scope are resolved server-side.
- Every dashboard feature uses the Cloudflare API/D1 as its only active business writer.
- Automated tests cover authentication failure modes, staff provisioning, company/branch isolation, CRUD, stock invariants, sale idempotency, ledger balancing and error recovery.
- CI, build, lint, security checks and isolated preview smoke tests pass.
- No legacy resource is deleted, no live payment is enabled, and no production cutover occurs without a separate explicit approval.

## Explicitly not completed by this document

This runbook does not itself deploy the dashboard or API Worker, change DNS/secrets, migrate production data, apply remote migrations, remove dependencies, or activate payments. Those actions require verified implementation, tests and the release gate above.
